# Harmonic Optimizer

A Python package implementing a novel harmonic optimization algorithm for signal processing and system optimization.

## Features

- Core harmonic optimization algorithm based on the equation Φ = √(R·F)² + E²
- Specialized modules for:
  - Medical imaging optimization
  - Mechanical systems
  - Electrical systems
- Adaptive and direct optimization modes
- Comprehensive metrics and visualization tools

## Installation

```bash
pip install harmonic-optimizer
```

## Quick Start

```python
from harmonic_optimizer import HarmonicOptimizer, OptimizationParams
import numpy as np

# Create optimization parameters
params = OptimizationParams(
    R=1.2,  # Resonance factor
    F=0.8,  # Fuel efficiency
    E=1.0,  # Energy conversion
    constant=(1 + np.sqrt(5)) / 2  # Golden ratio
)

# Initialize optimizer
optimizer = HarmonicOptimizer(params)

# Optimize your signal
optimized_signal = optimizer.optimize(your_signal)
```
